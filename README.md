# ðŸ§  ChainMemory  

### A Simple Solidity Smart Contract for Storing Game States and Match Data on the Blockchain  

---

## ðŸ“œ Project Description  

**ChainMemory** is a beginner-friendly **Solidity smart contract** designed to store, track, and retrieve game states and match results directly on the blockchain.  

Itâ€™s perfect for developers or learners exploring how to build decentralized applications (dApps) that record game data in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way.  

This project serves as a foundational example of **blockchain-based game data storage**, paving the way for more advanced concepts like multiplayer matches, leaderboards, and tokenized rewards.  

---

## ðŸŽ® What It Does  

- Allows players to **save their game states or match progress** permanently on the blockchain.  
- Stores essential data like **player address**, **game state**, and **timestamp**.  
- Enables players to **retrieve past matches** and **view historical game data**.  
- Emits an event each time a new match is recorded, so front-end applications can react in real time.

## âœ¨ Features  

âœ… **Decentralized Storage** â€” All match data lives directly on the blockchain, not on centralized servers.  
âœ… **Player History** â€” Each player can access their entire game history at any time.  
âœ… **Timestamps** â€” Automatically logs when each match was saved.  
âœ… **Events** â€” Emits a `MatchStored` event every time new data is recorded.  
âœ… **Beginner-Friendly Code** â€” Simple, well-commented Solidity code for easy learning and experimentation.
