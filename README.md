# 🧠 ChainMemory  

### A Simple Solidity Smart Contract for Storing Game States and Match Data on the Blockchain  

---

## 📜 Project Description  

**ChainMemory** is a beginner-friendly **Solidity smart contract** designed to store, track, and retrieve game states and match results directly on the blockchain.  

It’s perfect for developers or learners exploring how to build decentralized applications (dApps) that record game data in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way.  

This project serves as a foundational example of **blockchain-based game data storage**, paving the way for more advanced concepts like multiplayer matches, leaderboards, and tokenized rewards.

## 🎮 What It Does  

- Allows players to **save their game states or match progress** permanently on the blockchain.  
- Stores essential data like **player address**, **game state**, and **timestamp**.  
- Enables players to **retrieve past matches** and **view historical game data**.  
- Emits an event each time a new match is recorded, so front-end applications can react in real time.

## ✨ Features  

✅ **Decentralized Storage** — All match data lives directly on the Ethereum blockchain, not on centralized servers.  
✅ **Player History** — Each player can access their entire game history at any time.  
✅ **Timestamps** — Automatically logs when each match was saved.  
✅ **Events** — Emits a `MatchStored` event every time new data is recorded.  
✅ **Beginner-Friendly Code** — Simple, well-commented Solidity code for easy learning and experimentation.
